        <p>This branch is stable and it is always, always safe to deploy from it or create new branches off of it. If you push something to master that is not tested or breaks the build, you break the social contract of the development team and you normally feel pretty bad about it. </p>

        <h3>Hotfix</h3>
        <p>When you want to start work on anything, you create a descriptively named branch off of the stable master branch.</p>
        <p>This has several advantages - one is that when you fetch, you can see the topics that everyone else has been working on. Another is that if you abandon a branch for a while and go back to it later, it’s fairly easy to remember what it was. It’s almost like a list of upcoming features with current rough status.</p>

        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <p>The fact that source branch and target branch are the same (it mean, without any other change was added) is an ideal situation because will not occur conflicts.</p>
        <p>We have manage our task to find the way that programming go agead in this scenario. Imagine</p>
        Imagine all the people working without conflicts. It's easy if you try. You may say that I'm a dreamer, uut I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us</p>
        <p>This is really important. It is the key for future coding strategy.</p>

            <p>We use the Pull Requests to review the code long before we actually want to merge it into master for deployment. If you are stuck in the progress of your feature or branch and need help or advice, or even if you have little or no code but some screenshot comps or general ideas, you open a pull request.</p>

    <h2>Push to named branches constantly</h2>
    <div id="scenario-04" class="col"></div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>Since the only thing we really have to worry about is the stable branch from a deployment standpoint, pushing to the server doesn’t mess anyone up or confuse things - everything that is not inside the stable branch is simply something being worked on. In consecuense, any not-merged branch can be tested, approved, discarded and deleted.</p>
      <p>Pushing everything to server your are backupping your work and more importantly, it puts everyone in constant communication. A simple <code>git fetch</code> will basically give you a TODO list of what every is currently working on.</p>
</pre>
      <p class="pro-tip">Use your initials letter as a branch prefix. For example. My name is Piero Blunda, and I create a branch named <code>pb/feature-description</code>. Work on one branch a time and focus to merge or discard the changes before opening a new one.</p>

        <p>All changes in the blue branch are included in the orange one. This usually happens when works only one programmer in the project, but also happen when blue branch and orange branch are not related at all.</p>
        <p>Again, this is an ideal situation, but it is absolutelly reachable if your team split task correctly. We need to work to being a ninja splitter taks instead of resolving conflicts.</p>

        <p>In this cases, changes in each feature branches are not shared. This is very common situation when multiple programmers works simulateneously.</p>
        <p>It would be a big problem if you need a piece of code of the other branch. Its happens when those branches are related, for example, when two programmers are working in the same section of the proyect. It generates conflicts, or generates unredeabble git-tree.</p>
        <p>It absolutelly will not represent any problem if you are splitting task in the right way and you are a non related task inside the same operation.</p>

        <p>In the rare situation you need to resolve a conflict, you only need to update your working branch from the stable branch in order to set up to date respect the target-branch.</p>
